# Sentinel — Dojo Bay Edition

A watch-only Bitcoin wallet for Android: track xpubs, addresses and cold-storage
wallets, derive receive addresses on the go, and broadcast pre-signed
transactions — entirely over Tor, paired exclusively with a Bitcoin Dojo you
control (or one from the community directory; visit https://DojoBay.org for more info).

This is a community continuation, not a new project. Credit where it belongs:

- **Samourai Wallet** — original Sentinel (code preserved in the [Samourai-Wallet GitHub org](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet); their web domains were seized in 2024 and later hosted phishing — treat any samouraiwallet.* site as hostile)
- [btcwrestle/sentinel-android](https://github.com/btcwrestle/sentinel-android) —
  the Dojo Bay integration that gave the project its post-2024 purpose, and the
  Dojo-or-nothing direction after upstream infrastructure was seized
- fixes adopted from wanderingking072's fork (authored by @MightyMercurian)

## Lineage

Upstream Samourai Sentinel went dark in 2024. btcwrestle revived it as the Dojo
Bay edition; this fork began at btcwrestle:master commit 36a7e27 ("Dojo
onboarding, BIP84 default, UTXO labels, staging CI, and Network screen fixes",
2026-09-06) and continues the maintenance arc here. Work flows back upstream
via pull requests — our BIP-329 work was offered upstream (btcwrestle#5) and
closed unmerged while upstream has been quiet since September 2026, so this
repository is the live continuation as of October 2026. The histories share a
common root; upstream holds nothing we lack.

- Bad Bank Tainted (mixed-input propagation) — #54
- UTXO labels as chips in tx details — #55

  wide rounds, boltzmann-rs port for 6x6-9x9 — #107
- Boltzmann single-interpretation display for whirlpool remixes — #72

- Network detection derivation (testnet fix) — #42

## Label engine

Labels are a first-class subsystem:

- **Whirlpool autolabels** classify TX0/mix/remix transactions from account
  identity alone — no explorer lookups, never implying anonymity gain.
- **Bad Bank** pins the toxic change output ("badbank") of Whirlpool TX0s and
  propagates the label to descendant spends of wallet-derived UTXOs; the
  mixed-input (Tainted) class is the queued next phase.
- **BIP-329** is the storage format: import/export/edit/render with total
  parser semantics (absent label = do not alter, empty = explicit clear,
  cross-network refs rejected, origin and createdAt preserved), verified
  round-trip against Sparrow in both directions. Labels are privacy-sensitive
  metadata: stored locally only, network-scoped, hidden under street mode.

Manual and imported labels always win over automatic ones.

## Tor and Dojo behavior

- Embedded Tor runs in-process (kmp-tor 2.x TorRuntime) with a watchdog that
  recovers boot=0 wedges: stop first, wipe tor state, rebuild, restart —
  bounded, with a retryable error when the recovery budget is exhausted.
- The connection light is GREEN only at boot=100 with a live SOCKS listener;
  the post-ON climb renders as legible stage summaries on the Network screen
  and during Dojo import.
- The first sync round and websocket connect are gated on full bootstrap;
  directory-fetch probe failures explain themselves in plain language with
  one auto-retry.
- Directory and Dojo traffic goes only through the app's SOCKS proxy to onion
  services; the Dojo Bay directory itself is an onion service. No clearnet
  Samourai endpoints are contacted (leftovers are tracked in #3). Sentinel
  never holds your private keys.

## Releases

Tagging a `v*` tag runs the release workflow: a gated job builds the staging
flavor and publishes the APK plus a SHA256SUMS.txt to GitHub Releases. First
pipeline release: v5.1.3-dojobay.1 (staged as a prerelease; the app reports
5.1.2 internally — the release-line decision is tracked in #66).

## For testers

The staging flavor installs as **Sentinel Beta** (applicationId
`com.samourai.sentinel.staging`) and coexists with a production Sentinel
install. Grab an APK from the
[Releases](https://github.com/tetragrammalol/sentinel-android-dojobay/releases)
page, from the
[Actions](https://github.com/tetragrammalol/sentinel-android-dojobay/actions)
build-staging-apk artifacts, or build it:

    ./gradlew :app:assembleStagingDebug

Requires a JDK 25+ compatible toolchain (Room runs via KSP; kapt is gone).
minSdk is 23 (Android 6.0+).
