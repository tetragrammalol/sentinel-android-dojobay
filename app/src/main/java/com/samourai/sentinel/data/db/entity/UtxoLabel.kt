 * A user-defined label for a specific transaction output (BIP329 "output"
 * record), keyed by outpoint and network.
 *
 * Stored in a dedicated table (never merged into the sync-managed
 * [com.samourai.sentinel.data.Utxo] rows) so labels survive backend UTXO
 * replacement during syncs, and persist even after the output is spent -
 * useful wallet history and BIP329 round-tripping both require that.
 *
 * [network] ("mainnet"/"testnet") prevents label collisions if the install
 * is ever switched between networks.
