/**
 * Manual-provenance guard for the auto-writer (issue #6, part 2).
 * Pure JVM — no Android, Koin or Room dependencies.
 *
 * Truth table, on an EXISTING label row:
 *  - no row at all         -> Write    (fresh: auto may label)
 *  - origin starts auto:   -> Write    (our namespace, safe to refresh)
 *  - origin null           -> HandsOff (manual user label, or a hand clear)
 *  - origin foreign        -> HandsOff (BIP-329 / Sparrow import)
 *  - origin empty string   -> HandsOff (never widen our namespace to it)
 *
 * The null ambiguity is load-bearing: a missing row and a row with a
 * null origin are DIFFERENT facts. Callers must distinguish them —
 * see WhirlpoolAutoWriter.Sink. A hand clear keeps the row (blank
 * label, null origin) so the next sync still sees HandsOff and does
 * not write the auto label back.
